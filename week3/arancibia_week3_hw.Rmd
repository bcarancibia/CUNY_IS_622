What is the communication cost of each of the following algorithms, as a function of the size of the relations, matrices, or vectors to which they are applied?

(a) The matrix-vector multiplication algorithm

Communication cost: $O(r * c)$

The matrix-vector multiplication algorithm ($M \cdot v$) produces a key value pair for each entry in the matirx $M$. The communication cost is $O(r * c)$ where $r$ and $c$ are the number of rows and columns of $M$.

(b) The union algorithm

Communication cost: $O(r + s)$

In the union of $R$ and $S$, the mapper funtion passes key value pairs for each entry in $R$ and $S$. The communication cost is the total number of entries in *r* plus the total number of entries in *s* or $O(r + s)$.


(c) The aggregation algorithm of Section 2.3.8.
