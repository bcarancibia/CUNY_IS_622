3.5.1 (b)

1. d(x, y) ≥ 0 (no negative distances).
2. d(x,y) = 0 if and only if x = y (distances are positive, except for the distance from a point to itself).
3. d(x, y) = d(y, x) (distance is symmetric).
4. d(x, y) ≤ d(x, z) + d(z, y) (the triangle inequality).

Exercise 3.5.1 : On the space of nonnegative integers, which of the following functions are distance measures? If so, prove it; if not, prove that it fails to satisfy one or more of the axioms.



(b) diff(x, y) = |x − y| (the absolute magnitude of the difference between x and y).


1. Meets absolute value (no negative distance)
2. Meets true for x=y and x=y=0
3. Meets because absolute value |x-y|=|x-y|
4. |x-y| ≤ |x-z|+|z-y| needs to be true.

a)
z<x<y
|x-y| ≤ |x-z|+|z-y|
y-x ≤ x-z + y - z
2z ≤ 2x
z ≤ x

b) x < z < y
|x-y| ≤ |x-z|+|z-y|
y-x ≤ z-x+y-z
0 ≤ 0

c) x < y < i
|x-y| ≤ |x-z|+|z-y|
y-x ≤ z-x+y-z
2y ≤ 2z
y ≤ z
